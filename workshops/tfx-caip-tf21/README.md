# Continuous training with TFX and Cloud AI Platform

This series of hands on labs guides you through the process of implementing a TensorFlow Extended (TFX) continuous training pipeline that automates training and deployment of a TensorFlow 2.1 model.

The below diagram represents the workflow orchestrated by the pipeline.

The ML model utilized in the labs  is a multi-class classifier that predicts the type of  forest cover from cartographic data. The model is trained on the [Covertype Data Set](/datasets/covertype/README.md) dataset.
