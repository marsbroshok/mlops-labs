# ML Engineering on Google Cloud Platform

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)


This repository mantains hands-on labs and code samples that demonstrate best practices and patterns for implementing and operationalizing production grade machine learning workflows on Google Cloud Platform. 

## Navigating this repository
This repository is organized into three sections:
- [Workshops](./workshops/README.md)
- [Code samples](./examples/README.md)
- [Environment setup](./environment-setup/README.md)

### Environment Setup

Both workshops and code samples are designed to run in a reference MLOps environment. This section provides instructions and automation scripts for setting up the environment.

### Workshops
This section contains blueprints for instructor led ML Engineering workshops. It is expected that instructors will use them as a starting point to create a customized workshop addressing the needs of a specific audience. Multiple bluerprints can be combined to create a comprehensive, multi-day workshop. 

### Code Samples
This section compiles code samples demonstrating design and code patterns for a variety of ML Engineering topics. Each code sample is standalone and contains a brief description of the illustrated pattern.
